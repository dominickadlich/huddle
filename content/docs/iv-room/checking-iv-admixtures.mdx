## Priority of checking based on bin color 
- Yellow = STAT
- Green = Narcotic
- Blue = First dose
- Clear = Cartfill

## IV product label and production label matches 
- Same patient, medication, dose, etc. 

## Bag and base fluid 
- If a pre-made bag: correct bag/ fluid type and volume 
- If a pumped bag: check pictures in MedKeeper taken by tech of volume and fluid type 
- If an empty bag: check to see if a certain type of bag is needed (e.g. non DEHP) 

## Medication used matches production label 

Medication name, concentration, form (e.g. liposomal), vial size 
- Be aware of products with multiple concentrations: dexamethasone, methylprednisolone, gentamicin, phenobarbital, dilutions, etc. 

Check expiration date 
- Manufacturer expiration date not exceeded 
- Single dose vials- 6 hours, THROW AWAY 
- Multi dose vials- 28 days, MUST BE DATED! 
    - Exceptions: Octreotide 14days, Bactrim 48hrs 
- Batched product beyond use date not exceeded 

If reconstituted: 
- Refer to the “Non-Chemo Vial Reconstitution and Stability” document found here in Appendix B 
- If not on the reconstitution chart, follow the package insert 
- Reconstituted vial must be stickered with reconstitution information & expiration date 
- Initial the pharmacist checked line on the sticker if just reconstituted 

## Volume of medication used (pull back method)
- Do calculations make sense?
- Empty syringe pulled back to the volume indication on production label 
- Be aware of common concentration limitations: 
    - Acyclovir must not exceed 7mg/ml 
    - Bactrim is usually 5ml drug per 75ml fluid 

## Review special notes on production label 
- Special Tubing required – “Non-Chemo Tubing Reference Sheet” found in PolicyStat
